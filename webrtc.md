# What is WebRTC

WebRTC is the technology we use to ensure that as many people as possible can have a frictionless video consultation experience. WebRTC is a cross-platform standard for conducting video calls.

> WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communications) is a technology which enables Web applications and sites to capture and optionally stream audio and/or video media, as well as to exchange arbitrary data between browsers without requiring an intermediary. The set of standards that comprises WebRTC makes it possible to share data and perform teleconferencing peer-to-peer, without requiring that the user install plug-ins or any other third-party software.

WebRTC is a cross-platform, cross-vendor project thatâ€™s being standardized through the W3C and IETF.  There are a number of sub-protocols within the WebRTC stack, but the general workflow is that a signaling session is established via a server, and then a media channel directly between peers. The full handshake process is described here: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Connectivity>

**Microsoft Teams** : It is not currently possible to use OneConsultation with Microsoft Teams, due to the availble integration options with Microsoft Teams. As Teams evolves to support integrations from 3rd-party video providers [as announced at Ignite 2017](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2017/09/25/a-new-vision-for-intelligent-communications-in-office-365/) OneConsultation is well placed to take immediate advantage of this and offer it to all customers as soon as it becomes available.

## Client Support

**Desktop Clients** : OneConsultation works with all Skype for Business and Lync client versions, including those for Mac..

**Mobile Clients** : [testing in progress. please check back later.] 

## Hardware Requirements

OneConsultation uses the standard Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams clients with no addition plugins or software. Therefore hardware requirements are the same as for Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams.

System requirements for Skype for Business depend slightly on version and SKU but all combinations can be found here: https://products.office.com/en-gb/office-system-requirements

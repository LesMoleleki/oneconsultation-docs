**Microsoft Teams** : It is not currently possible to use OneConsultation with Microsoft Teams, due to the availble integration options with Microsoft Teams. As Teams evolves to support integrations from 3rd-party video providers [as announced at Ignite 2017](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2017/09/25/a-new-vision-for-intelligent-communications-in-office-365/) OneConsultation is well placed to take immediate advantage of this and offer it to all customers as soon as it becomes available.

# I'm a patient using OneConsultation - how can I make sure I have a good video call? 

* Internet connectivity: Without a good internet connection, you may experience a poor quality virtual consultation, where your audio and/or video freezes or drops. 
  * A wired ethernet connection to the internet is recommended wherever possible. 
  * Where wired connection is unavailable, try to ensure that you are on a good wifi connection. 
  * If you are using your home wifi, make sure that nobody else in the house is streaming games or TV, as this will impact your experience. 
  * If you find you are having a poor quality call on your home wifi connection, try moving closer to the router, as this may improve the call. 
  * If wifi is not available, a minimum of 4G is required. In some areas, a 4G connection may provide a better experience than public wifi. 
  * The same advice above on internet connectivity can be given to public users. 
* Your equipment: If your device doesn’t have a camera or microphone built-in, make sure you’ve followed the manufacturer’s guidelines for setting up any microphones or webcams to use with your device.  
* Your device and browser: You can check out a list of supported devices and browsers on the OneConsultation technical documentation site here: https://docs.oneconsultation.net/browsers.html - please note that Internet Explorer is not supported, and Apple users should ensure they are using Safari. 
* Your location: As you may be having confidential discussions, try to make sure that you are in a secure and private location to take part in your virtual consultation.    
* Lighting and environment: Try to make sure that you are in a quiet, well-lit location (ideally not directly in front of a window).

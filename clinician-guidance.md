# I'm a clinician using OneConsultation, how can I make sure I have a good video call? 

* If you are a Microsoft Teams user, there are some initial setup steps to complete before you use OneConsultation for the first time. You can find them [here](teams-users-initial-setup.md).
* Before you use OneConsultation, perform a test consultation with a colleague, with one person using their O365 credentials and one person using a personal device, acting as a public user. This allows you to experience the online consultation process before a live appointment.
* Internet connectivity: Without a good internet connection, you may experience a poor quality virtual consultation, where your audio and/or video freezes or drops. 
  * A wired ethernet connection to the internet is recommended wherever possible. 
  * Where wired connection is unavailable, try to ensure that you are on a good wifi connection. 
  * If you are using your home wifi, make sure that nobody else in the house is streaming games or TV, as this will impact your experience. 
  * If you find you are having a poor quality call on your home wifi connection, try moving closer to the router, as this may improve the call. 
  * If wifi is not available, a minimum of 4G is required. In some areas, a 4G connection may provide a better experience than public wifi. 
  * The same advice above on internet connectivity can be given to public users. 
* VPN: If you are working from home and you usually use VPN, we recommend turning this off for using OneConsultation. VPNs can cause poor quality calls because the video traffic has further to travel. 
* Your equipment: If your device doesn’t have a camera or microphone built-in, make sure you’ve followed the manufacturer’s guidelines for setting up any microphones or webcams to use with your device.  
* Your device and browser: You can check out a list of supported devices and browsers on the OneConsultation technical documentation site here: https://docs.oneconsultation.net/browsers.html - please note that Internet Explorer is not supported, and Apple users should ensure they are using Safari. 
Your location: As you may be having confidential discussions, try to make sure that you are in a secure and private location to take part in your virtual consultation.    
* Lighting and environment: Try to make sure that you are in a quiet, well-lit location (ideally not directly in front of a window).  
* If you are a Microsoft Teams user, you can blur your background, which can reduce distractions on the call
